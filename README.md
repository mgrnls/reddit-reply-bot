# Reddit reply bot
Small comment reply bot based on [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). This script will scan the comments of a subreddit as they come in and look for a trigger word. If a comment contains the trigger word, the script will reply with a random quote. Further, if the random quote that has been selected contains `!USERNAME`, the script will replace `!USERNAME` with the author of the comment it is replying to. The quotes should be placed in a text file called `quotes.txt`, and each quote should be placed on its own line.
